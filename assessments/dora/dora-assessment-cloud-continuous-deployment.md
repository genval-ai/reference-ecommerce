4. Implement automated rollback in CI/CD pipeline

#### Required Architectural Changes
1. Introduce a distributed tracing service
2. Implement a circuit breaker pattern in all services
3. Enhance the monitoring and alerting architecture

### 2.4 Change Failure Rate

#### Current Architectural Support
The microservices architecture allows for isolated deployments, potentially reducing the blast radius of changes. The use of containerization can also contribute to consistency between environments.

#### Identified Risks and Bottlenecks
1. Lack of comprehensive automated testing may lead to undetected issues
2. Insufficient production-like testing environments may result in environment-specific failures
3. Limited use of feature flags may increase the risk of failed changes

#### Improvement Opportunities
1. Implement comprehensive automated testing strategy
2. Enhance production-like testing environments
3. Implement feature flags for safer releases
4. Enhance monitoring and alerting for early detection of issues

#### Specific Technical Recommendations
1. Implement mutation testing to improve test quality (e.g., Pitest)
2. Use service virtualization for more accurate integration testing (e.g., Mountebank)
3. Implement chaos engineering practices (e.g., Chaos Monkey)
4. Enhance logging and implement log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack)
