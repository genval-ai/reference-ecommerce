# Shopify-Powered E-commerce Reference Implementation

This repository contains a reference implementation for a serverless e-commerce backend powered by Shopify and integrated with various services. The architecture is designed to be scalable, modular, and easily deployable using AWS CDK.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built using a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific domain of e-commerce functionality. The core of the system is powered by Shopify, with additional services integrated to provide a comprehensive e-commerce solution.

    B --> E[Shopify API]
    C --> E
    D --> F[Elastic Path API]
    G[Customer] --> A
```

### Key Components

1. **API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for all API requests, routing them to appropriate Lambda functions.
2. **Lambda Functions**: Handle business logic for different e-commerce capabilities:
   - Product Management
   - Order Management
   - Cart Management
3. **Shopify Integration**: Used for product and order management.
4. **Elastic Path Integration**: Used for cart management.

## Detailed Service Architecture

The system is composed of several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain of e-commerce functionality. Here's a more detailed view of the services and their interactions:

    G --> P[Loyalty Database]
    H --> Q[Promotions Database]
    I --> R[Search Index]
    J --> S[Tax Rules Database]
    K --> T[Pricing Database]
```

## Service Descriptions

1. **Product Management**: Handles product creation, updates, and retrieval. Integrated with Shopify's product catalog.
2. **Order Management**: Manages order creation, updates, and retrieval. Uses Shopify's order management system.
3. **Cart Management**: Handles shopping cart operations. Integrated with Elastic Path for advanced cart functionality.
4. **Customer Management**: Manages customer profiles and data.
5. **Inventory Service**: Tracks product inventory levels across locations.
6. **Loyalty Service**: Manages customer loyalty programs, points, and rewards.
7. **Promotions**: Handles creation and application of promotional offers and discounts.
8. **Search Service**: Provides product search and discovery functionality.
9. **Tax Calculation**: Calculates taxes for orders based on various rules and jurisdictions.
10. **Pricing Service**: Manages product pricing, including dynamic and personalized pricing.
