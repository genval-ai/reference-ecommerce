# Shopify Powered E-commerce React Application

This project is a React-based front-end for a Shopify-powered e-commerce system. It provides a user interface for browsing products, managing a shopping cart, and completing the checkout process.

## Getting Started in GitHub Codespace

These instructions will help you set up and run the project in a GitHub Codespace environment.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Access to this repository

### Setting up the Codespace

1. Navigate to the main page of this repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Code" button, then select "Open with Codespaces".
3. Click on "New codespace" to create a new Codespace for this project.

GitHub will now create and configure your Codespace. This process may take a few minutes.

### Running the Application

Once your Codespace is ready:

1. Open a new terminal in the Codespace (if one isn't already open).

2. Navigate to the `generated-ui` directory:
   ```
   cd generated-ui
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. A notification should appear asking if you want to open the application in a browser. Click "Open in Browser" to view the application.

If the notification doesn't appear, you can typically access the application by clicking on the "Ports" tab in the bottom panel of the Codespace, finding the forwarded port (usually 3000), and clicking the globe icon next to it to open the URL in a browser.

### Building the Project

To create a production build of the application:

1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the `generated-ui` directory.

2. Run the build command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

This will create a `build` directory with a production build of your app.
