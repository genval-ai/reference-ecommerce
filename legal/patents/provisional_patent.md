Key components of the invention include:

1. A modular architecture that allows for easy integration of various e-commerce capabilities.
2. A comprehensive product management system with advanced categorization and variant handling.
3. A sophisticated order management system that handles the entire order lifecycle.
4. An intelligent customer segmentation and loyalty management capability.
5. Dynamic pricing and promotion engines that can adapt to market conditions and customer behavior.
6. Advanced search and recommendation systems to enhance product discovery.
7. Seamless integration with multiple payment gateways and shipping providers.
