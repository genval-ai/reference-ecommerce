## Aspect Behaviors


### Trace Request Initiation
Implements end-to-end request tracing across services for performance monitoring and debugging in distributed systems.

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `trace-request-initiation` |

**Behavior Objective**

Generate and attach a unique trace ID to incoming requests at the entry point of the system

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

When a request first enters the system, generate a unique trace ID and attach it to the request context. This should be done before any business logic is executed. For cart-related operations, this can be implemented by intercepting the incoming requests and adding the trace ID before executing the cart management operations.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|


### Propagate Trace Context
Implements end-to-end request tracing across services for performance monitoring and debugging in distributed systems.

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `propagate-trace-context` |

**Behavior Objective**

Ensure trace context is propagated across service boundaries in all inter-service communications

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

When making calls between services, ensure the trace context (including trace ID and span information) is included in the request headers or message metadata. This should be implemented for all service-to-service communications.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|


### Record Span Timing
Implements end-to-end request tracing across services for performance monitoring and debugging in distributed systems.

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `record-span-timing` |

**Behavior Objective**

Measure and record timing information for each operation or span within the trace

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

For each operation within a service, create a new span with timing information including start time, end time, and duration. Tag spans with relevant metadata such as operation name, service name, and any error information.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cache | [`get-cache-item`](../../capability/cache#get-cache-item) | Measure cache operation timing and record as spans within the trace |


### Store Trace Data
Implements end-to-end request tracing across services for performance monitoring and debugging in distributed systems.

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `store-trace-data` |

**Behavior Objective**

Persistently store collected trace data for later analysis and debugging

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

Implement a mechanism to collect and store trace data including spans, timing information, and metadata in a format that allows for easy querying and analysis. Consider using a specialized trace storage system or time-series database.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|


### Correlation Identification
Implements end-to-end request tracing across services for performance monitoring and debugging in distributed systems.

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `correlation-identification` |

**Behavior Objective**

Enable identification of related requests and operations across the distributed system

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

Implement correlation ID generation and propagation across all services. Include business context identifiers (such as order ID, customer ID) in trace data to enable correlation of traces with business transactions.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Customer Management | [`get_customer`](../../capability/customer-management#get_customer) | Include customer ID in trace context for customer-related operations |
