## Aspect Behaviors


### Rate Limit API Requests
Controls the frequency of operations to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource utilization

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `rate-limit-requests` |

**Behavior Objective**

Implement request rate limiting to prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specified time window

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

Use a distributed cache to track request counts per client identifier (e.g., API key or IP address) within sliding time windows. Increment counters for each request and block if thresholds are exceeded. Cache entries should expire after the time window.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cache | [`get-cache-item`](../../capability/cache#get-cache-item) | Check current request count for client within time window |
| Cache | [`set-cache-item`](../../capability/cache#set-cache-item) | Update request count and timestamp for client |


### Throttle High-Frequency Operations
Controls the frequency of operations to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource utilization

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `throttle-high-frequency` |

**Behavior Objective**

Apply specific rate limits to operations that are resource-intensive or commonly abused

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

Identify high-risk operations and apply stricter rate limits. Monitor usage patterns and adjust thresholds dynamically. Consider implementing progressive throttling where limits become stricter with increased usage.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Logging Service | [`log-message`](../../capability/logging-service#log-message) | Log throttling events and usage patterns |


### Implement Exponential Backoff
Controls the frequency of operations to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource utilization

**Behavior Metadata**
| Property | Value |
|----------|------|
| Behavior Code | `implement-backoff` |

**Behavior Objective**

Implement gradual request rate reduction for clients that repeatedly hit rate limits

**Behavior Implementation Instructions**

Track repeated rate limit violations and implement exponential backoff periods for subsequent requests. Store violation history in cache with appropriate expiration.

**Behavior Operation Use**
| Capability | Operation | Use Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cache | [`set-cache-item`](../../capability/cache#set-cache-item) | Store violation history and backoff periods |
